### üîç The magic lens for Overpass queries

OverScry is a tool designed to simplify the process of generating Overpass queries from a YML structure file. By taking a structured YML input that defines specific geographical data and search parameters, OverScry automatically converts it into a valid Overpass query. Overall it makes it easier for both beginners and experts to leverage Overpass API capabilities without needing to understand how to write complex raw queries.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Installing the tool can currently only be done via Go and Docker.

#### Go

You need to have [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed. You can then install using:

```bash
go install github.com/kkrypt0nn/overscry@latest
```

You can then generate a query with the basic examples in the [examples](_examples) folder with

```bash
overscry gen --settings _examples/housenumber.yml
```

#### Docker

You can run the tool from the published [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/kkrypt0nn/overscry) using:

```bash
docker run -v .:/data -it kkrypt0nn/overscry gen --settings /data/_examples/housenumber.yml
```

### Example Usage

After installing you can run the tool with

```bash
overscry --help
```

This will give you the list of commands and their respective flags.

## Settings YML File

The YML file for the settings has the following example structure

```yml
version: 0.0.1-dev
author: Krypton (@kkrypt0nn)
description: A query to get every house with number 1337
node:
  addr:
    housenumber:
      value: 1337
      match: equals
```

A lot of work is put into so that more arguments and features/tags are supported. Please be patient for upcoming changes.
