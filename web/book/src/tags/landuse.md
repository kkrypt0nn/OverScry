Only the following `value`s are allowed:

### Developed land

* `commercial` - Predominantly commercial businesses and their offices. Commercial businesses which sell goods should be categorised as `retail`. Commercial businesses can sell services on site and may include private Doctor's Surgeries, and those non-government services for mental and physical health, such as a Counselor's or Physiotherapist's practice or Veterinary. Commercial businesses can also include office buildings and business parks which have limited interface with the public and sell their services either on site, or externally. Commercial businesses have low amounts of public foot traffic.
* `construction` - A site which is under active development and construction of a building or structure, including any purposeful alteration to the land or vegetation upon it. Abandoned construction projects and sites should not use this tag.

* `fairground` - A site where a [fair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair) takes place.
* `industrial` - Predominantly industrial landuses such as workshops, factories, or warehouses.
* `residential` - Land where people reside; predominantly residential detached (single houses, grouped dwellings), or attached (apartments, flats, units) dwellings. For "Mixed-Use" areas where more than half of the land is residential, tag as residential.
* `retail` - Predominantly retail businesses such as shops. Retail businesses sell physical goods such as food (prepared or grocery), clothing, medicine, stationary, appliances, tools, or other similar physical items. Retail businesses have high amounts of public foot traffic. Retail businesses do not exclusively provide or sell their services. For businesses which sell services see `commercial`.
