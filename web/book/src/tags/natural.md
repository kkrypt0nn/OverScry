Only the following `value`s are allowed:

### Vegetation

* `fell` - Habitat above tree line covered with grass, dwarf shrubs and mosses.
* `heath` - A dwarf-shrub habitat, characterised by open, low growing woody vegetation, often dominated by plants of the Ericaceae.
* `scrub` - Uncultivated land covered with shrubs, bushes or stunted trees.
* `tree` - A single tree.
* `wood` - Tree-covered area (a 'forest' or 'wood').

### Water related

* `bay` - Named area of water mostly surrounded by land but with level connection to the ocean or a lake.
* `beach` - Landform along a body of water which consists of sand, shingle or other loose material.
* `blowhole` - An opening to a sea cave which has grown landwards resulting in blasts of water from the opening due to the wave action.
* `cape` - A piece of elevated land sticking out into the sea or large lake.
* `geyser` - A spring characterized by intermittent discharge of water ejected turbulently and accompanied by steam.
* `glacier` - A permanent body of ice formed naturally from snow that is moving under its own weight.
* `hot_spring` - A spring of geothermally heated groundwater.
* `isthmus` - A narrow strip of land, bordered by water on both sides and connecting two larger land masses.
* `peninsula` - A piece of land projecting into water from a larger land mass, nearly surrounded by water.
* `reef` - A feature (rock, sandbar, coral, etc) lying permanently beneath the surface of the water.
* `spring` - A place where ground water flows naturally from the ground.
* `strait` - A narrow area of water surrounded by land on two sides and by water on two other sides.
* `water` - Any inland body of water, from natural such as a lake or pond to artificial like a moat or canal.

### Geology related

* `arch` - A rock arch naturally formed by erosion, with an opening underneath.
* `cave_entrance` - An entrance to a cave: a natural underground space large enough for a human to enter.
* `cliff` - A vertical or almost vertical natural drop in terrain, usually with a bare rock surface. The bottom of the cliff is on the right side of the way.
* `dune` - A hill of sand formed by wind, covered with no or very little vegetation.
* `fumarole` - A fumarole is an opening in a planet's crust, which emits steam and gases.
* `hill` - A hill is a landform that is elevated above the surrounding terrain, but is smaller than a mountain.
* `peak` - The top (summit) of a hill or mountain.
* `rock` - A notable rock or group of rocks attached to the underlying bedrock.
* `saddle` - The lowest point along a ridge or between two mountain tops.
* `sinkhole` - A natural depression or hole in the surface topography.
* `stone` - A single notable freestanding rock, which may differ from the composition of the terrain it lies in.
* `valley` - A natural depression flanked by ridges or ranges of mountains or hills.
* `volcano` - An opening exposed on the earth's surface where volcanic material is emitted.
